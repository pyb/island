island game, clone of the HP48 classic by Mathieu Peyral

Briefly, this is a resource management game where you have to take control of all the islands. Island population increases by 10% every turn, provided there is enough agriculture. Each Mine brings 2000 gold each turn. Conquer islands by moving your population across or sending mercenaries.

The commands are Buy, Sell and Move : 
b 2 pop 10 : buy 10 population on island 2
s 5 agri 4 : sell 4 agriculture on island 5
m 6 7 10 : move 10 population from island 7 to island 6 (this is an attack if you don't own island 6). Make sure you have enough boats ('bato')
m 6 10 : attack island 6 with 10 mercenaries 
e : end turn

Moves and attacks are only resolved after every player has completed his turn.
